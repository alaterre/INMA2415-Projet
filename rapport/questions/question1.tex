% QUESTION 1

The profit margin of each generator in the system are shown on figures [\ref{fig:biomass}],[\ref{fig:nuclear}], [\ref{fig:gas}], and [\ref{fig:oil}]. The dotted lines represent the investment cost for each type of generator. Apparently, generators tend to have a profit margin below their investment cost. Although one or two generators per technology play their cards right, shareholders are far from a return on their investments. The question is therefore, whether or not it is wise to continue to invest, based on those results. Hard to say. Take for example the nuclear generators. Even if it's not doing so bad, continue to invest in may reduce profitability. Indeed, nuclear generators are usually used to satisfy the most stable part of the demand. However, if it has already been fully sated, investing in nuclear will not increase profitability as new generators will not be used very often.\\

The second model leads to more profitable generators, even if the improvement isn't incredible. The only reason is that the demand level is higher than in the first model since the amount of energy imported from neighboring markets are not deduce anymore from the demand level.\\

Notice that almost all generators tends to be more profitable in the ORDC model. It comes from the fact that the ORDC model tends to ask for far more reserve than the fixed reserve requirement of the first two models. And since reserves have physical no cost, the generators generate huge profits without producing anything. \\

Finally, figure [\ref{fig:margin}] shows the average profit margin for each kind of generators and for each model. The conclusion is the same for all of them : generators are not money-making.
